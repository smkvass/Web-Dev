    <h1>Write a Poem</h1>
    <p>How do you like to go up in a swing,<br>
Up in the air so blue?<br>
Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing,<br>
Ever a child can do!<br>
<br>
Up in the air and over the wall,<br>
Till I can see so wide,<br>
Rivers and trees and cattle and all<br>
Over the countrysideâ€”<br>
