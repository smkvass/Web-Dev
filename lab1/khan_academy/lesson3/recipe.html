        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Press the crumbs into the bottom and slightly up the sides of the pan using the bottom of a glass or measuring cup.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place the cream cheese in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer with the whip attachment. Beat on medium-low speed until creamy and smooth. Add the sugar, salt, vanilla extract, and lemon juice. Beat until the mixture is well combined and completely smooth. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times during mixing to ensure everything is well incorporated.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> With the mixer on medium-low speed, add the eggs one at a time.Stop and scrape down the bowl between additions.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pour the batter into the cooled crust. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 300Â°F and continue baking for another 30 to 35 minutes or until the edges of the filling are just slightly puffed and the center wobbles slightly when shaken gently. Turn off the oven and leave it in there with the door closed for 1 hour. Remove the cheesecake and let it cool at room temperature for another hour, then chill it in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or up to 3 days before serving. </p>
